Hello, this is file2

1)What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A: it creates an empty repository with untracked files, in order for us to commint the files, we need to add them to the track.

2)How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
A: the staging area shows the tracked/untracked files for commits, it allows you to add/remove file to staging area, but has no affect on working directory.
